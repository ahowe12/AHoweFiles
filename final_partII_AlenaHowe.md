# Final Project, Part II

**User Research Protocol**

*Target Audiences* 

There are two target audiences that I hope to reach with my story:
1.	Museum fundraisers: They are tasked with making a case for why their institution needs sustained or increased funding. They could use my visualizations to better understand how competitive/saturated their market is or to make a case for why their institution is vital to their community (especially for communities that have little access to museums). They would use this information when writing a grant for a foundation or soliciting a donor. They would focus on the supply and demand of museums on a per capita basis.
2.	General public: These visualizations would help people outside of the museum field understand how broad and diverse this sector is and demonstrate how little or how much access they have to these resources. For people who aren’t aware of the museums in their geographic area, my visualizations might encourage them to explore their local museum sector. For people who participate in the arts, my visualizations might encourage them to start donating or increase their giving to the institutions that they value. 

*Interviewees*

I’m going to identify individuals to interview based on my knowledge of their engagement in the arts. For instance, I plan on interviewing a couple of students in my Advanced Fundraising class, because they are knowledgeable about the impact of the arts sector as well as donor motivations to give. They are my “expert” audience. My “novice” audience that more closely represents the general public will be individuals outside of the MAM program who aren’t as familiar with the field. I will get feedback from my roommate, boyfriend, and non-MAM classmates in Telling Stories with Data. My goals for the interview are to gauge whether the participants understand what the visualizations are about as well as their level of interest in the content (do they want to learn more/did they learn something new). 

*Interview Script*

Thank you for participating in this feedback exercise for my Telling Stories with Data class. For my final project, I’m using data visualizations to craft a story about the vibrancy of the museum field in the United States. Vibrancy is measured by the concentration of museums and related institutions per capita in a geographic area. This measure is used to better understand how these organizations are serving their communities, what these communities value, and where inequities in access exist. In the next ten minutes, I’m going to ask you several questions about the storyboard and visualizations that I have drawn for this exercise and will take handwritten notes on your responses. My questions will be focused on the target audience, the flow of the story, and the effectiveness of the visualizations. Your responses, including quotes, are anonymous and will be posted to my public GitHub page. Do you have any questions before we begin? 

*Interview Questions*

Before showing the visualizations: 
1.	How many times per year do you visit museums or participate in arts and cultural activities?
2.	What types of institutions come to mind when thinking about the museum/cultural sector? 
3.	How many museums do you think there are in the United States?  

Questions about the visualizations:
1.	What do you think this story is about?
2.	Who do you think the target audience is?
3.	Is there anything that confuses you about these visualizations?
4.	What would you change?
5.	Did you learn anything new?
6.	Is there a part of this story that you feel is missing? 

*Interview Findings*

- Interviewee #1: TBD
- Interviewee #2: TBD
- Interviewee #3: TBD
- Interviewee #4: TBD
- Interviewee #5: TBD

*Post-Interview Changes*

TBD - Changes implemented to sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.

**Personas**

I used the Hubspot persona generator to create personas for my target audiences. The first persona is Maria who represents the museum fundraiser target audience. The second persona is Daniel who represents the general public target audience.

**Mood Board**

My moodboard includes images of engaged museum visitors, infographics, and data visualizations of the museum sector.
