# Part 1

**Outline**

*Summary* 

In the Master of Arts Management program, we often talk about the crucial role that museums and non-profit arts organizations play in creating vibrant communities. One way to measure vibrancy is by the number and diversity of these institutions at the national, regional, state, and local levels. My story will show which areas of our country have the highest or lowest concentrations per capita of museum and related institutions as well as the areas with the most investment in these institutions. 

*Story Arc*

I’m going to model my story arc off of the Situation-Complication-Resolution structure presented in the Gavin McMahon’s “Use these story structures to make messages people talk about” article posted on Fastforward.com. The structure presents a situation (where are we now), then introduces a complication (what challenge we face), and ends with a resolution (call to action/proposed solution). 

I’m going to begin my story by talking briefly about the qualitative measures of vibrancy in the museums sector, such as the positive community impact created by museum services. Essentially, I’ll build a case for why museums matter. Then, I’m then going to talk about the disparity in museum access by showing the distribution of museums and related institutions on a map of the United States. That visualization will be presented along with visualizations about museums per capita and museum revenue and income. I’ll end my story by making a case for why federal funding, especially equitable funding, of the arts is so vital to our communities. I’ll provide resources for how the average American as well as museum professionals can advocate for museums. 

*Call to Action*

My call to action will make a case for equitable museum funding by emphasizing the critical role that museums and related institutions play in our communities and where disparities in museum access exist. I’ll ask average Americans to advocate for or donate to museums, compel museum professionals to become more involved in advocacy efforts, and ask grantmakers and federal agencies to increase efforts to provide equitable funding. 

*User Stories*

This story will be relevant to museum professionals who are trying to make a case for why their institution needs sustained or increased funding or why their institution is vital to their geographic area. It would help them better understand what types of arts organizations that their community values. 

Grantmakers (such as foundations) and federal agencies (such as the IMLS, the NEA, and the NEH) are another audience for this story. Grantmakers struggle to distribute funding equitably – funding a balance of large, powerhouse institutions and small/young non-profits. These visualizations will help show funders which parts of our country have a large arts and cultural impact versus those who need more support to grow their arts and cultural sector. 

The third potential audience for this story is the typical American who might not know about the diverse makeup of our country’s museum/non-profit arts sector. For instance, a typical person may think of the museum sector as comprising art museums, history museums, children’s museums, and the like, but may not know that this sector also includes zoos, aquariums, historical societies, science centers, etc. Many people don’t know how little federal funding these institutions receive compared to other sectors as well as the disparities in income across institutions and regions. These visualizations, along with additional research about museum services and funding, would inform the average person about how vital these institutions are to our communities. It might also surprise them how much, or how little, access they have to these institutions in their geographic area.


**Initial Sketches**

My sketches aim to show which parts of our country have the highest and/or lowest number of museums/arts organizations per geographical area or per capita by state. They show which parts of our country value certain types of organization over others. They also show how state population correlates to museum revenue depending on the discipline. These visualizations will help me make a case for which areas of our country could benefit from increased investment in the arts.

**Data**

*Overview*

My data comes from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which is the primary source of federal support for museums and libraries in the United States. IMLS supports the communities served by museums and libraries by conducting research, distributing grants, and developing policy. 

The data that I’m using for this project is broken into three sets: primary museum disciplines (7,429 entries), uncategorized or general museums (7,959 entries), and historical societies and historical preservation (14,783 entries). In 2015, IMLS collected this data for 30,000 institutions from the IRS 990 forms, private foundation grantee lists, and third party commercial vendor data. The data sets were published in 2018. The other data set that I’m using is the population data from the 2010 US Census. This data set also provides estimates of the US population up to 2015. 

Using this data, I’m going to create visualizations that speak to the vibrancy of arts and cultural communities across the country. I’m going to calculate the number of museums per capita by state, museum revenue per capita, and museum disciplines by state/region. I also want to calculate the number of organizations per region, state, city, and/or zip code. These calculations will build a case for which parts of our country need increased investment in the arts.

**Method & Medium**

Now that I have my data sets and an idea for the story that I’m going to tell, my next steps will involve analyzing the data, conducting research, and obtaining user feedback about the wireframes and content that I’m going to build out in the coming week.

Starting with analyzing the data, I’m going to read through the Museum Data Files’ User Guide provided by the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences (IMLS). This guide gives an overview of the processes used to collect and clean the data, the data sources and their limitations, and explanations of the abbreviated category names and codes used in the data set. Once I’m familiar with this information, I’m going to experiment with different visualizations in Tableau and RAWGraphs. I anticipate using line charts and bar charts, and potentially an alluvial diagram to show multi categorical data or some sort of distribution or hierarchical visualization. The data sets contain geographical data, so I want to explore online tools that can help me visualize the data on a map. 

I will also conduct research on museum fudning, impact, and access (e.g. museums per capita in the United States) using sources such as IMLS, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the American Alliance of Museums (AAM), Americans for the Arts, etc. 

Once I have the research to flesh out my story, I will create wireframes either by hand or using online tools, like Basalmiq and Wireframestogo.com, which will be used to gain user feedback from friends and classmates. 

For my final project deliverable, I plan on building my story using Shorthand. Looking at Shorthand’s templates, I like the clean look of the website and the content structure. I will need to find images in the public domain to add this is site as well as a list of source citations. For my presentation, I plan on presenting my story and data visualization using my Shorthand website.
