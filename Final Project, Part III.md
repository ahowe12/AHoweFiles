**Audience:**

There are two audiences for my story: museum professionals and the general public. The first half of my story, which focuses on defining the museum sector and addressing common misconceptions about the field, is more geared toward the general public, but this information also germane to museum professionals. The second half of my story, which focuses on IMLS funding, is more relevant to museum professionals than it is to the general public. The call to action applies to both audiences. The general public can support museums by visiting, becoming a member, and donating. The call to action pertaining more to museum professionals is to advocate for increased and more equitable IMLS funding as well as participate in advocacy events. 

The links to my personas are provided below:

- Persona 2: [Daniel - General Public](Persona - Daniel.pdf)

The main way that I kept these audiences in mind when making my final project was to split the content into two sections: one for defining the museum sector and the other for exploring the equity of IMLS funding. I also tried to limit the number and complexity of the charts in my final project. I had originally planned to take a deeper dive into this topic, such as museums per capita and IMLS funding distributions on a more granular level, but adding that complexity muddled my message. I also experimented with different types of visualizations to try to make the presentation of the data more interesting. However, the types of visualizations that I ended up using were pretty basic: line charts, bar charts, tree map chart, etc. I aimed to present that story so that someone who knew very little about the museum sector could understand the visualizations. For this reason, I included a lengthier narrative in some parts of the project that provides more background information about the museum sector.  


**What I Learned/How My Project Changed:**

The major takeaway that I have from this project is that the museum field has very little data that is complete and accessible. This potentially contributes to the people working in the sector and funding the sector making decisions that aren’t fully informed. At the start of this project, I had an idea of the story that I wanted to tell in my mind and tried to find data that would support that narrative. What I learned along the way was that my original idea was very ambitious and would require multiple data sets that weren’t publicly available. For instance, I couldn’t find consolidated funding data or the right census data. A lot of the data that I needed cost upwards of $200 and the majority of it focused on the arts sector instead of the museum sector. 

Due to these issues with finding data, I stuck with using the IMLS Museum Data Files as the base of my story and used Tabula to extract smaller data sets from IMLS’ annual reports. I decided to drop the census data component. In addition to extracting data from reports and websites, I also had to do a lot of work in Excel to clean up these data sets and format them to work together in Tableau.   

I’m glad that I decided to stick with Tableau to complete this project. There was a significant learning curve that I had to overcome having never used a program like Tableau before. Since my story and my data sets had changed by the time that I was going to create the final visualizations, I spent a lot of time experimenting in Tableau. Starting with the IMLS Museum Data Files, I made a lot of extra visualizations to understand what story the data could tell. The majority of these were later deleted. Based on the few visualizations that seemed effective from these data sets, I was able to find additional IMLS data to build out my story. However, I still feel like there are pieces that are missing to make an impactful, specific call to action. I guess part of my call to action is that the museum field needs better data in order to understand its impact and make a case for increased IMLS appropriations. 

When it came time to export my visualizations, I struggled to figure out the process of getting the HTML code to embed in Shorthand. A few of my visualizations had filters that I wanted to use as an interactive element in my final project. In the end, I exported my charts as images. I realize that this approach isn’t the most efficient way to display filtered versions of my charts. There’s still a lot of features of Tableau that I hope to learn. One of my goals is to become more skilled at working with code. The GitHub part of the class allowed me to start working toward that goal.

I chose to build out my final project in Shorthand, because I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to learn a new platform. I liked how easy it is to place and cite images in Shorthand. I liked that it has a limited selection of layouts but sometimes these options were limiting. I couldn’t always place my visualizations in line with the accompanying text, which may make my story read disjointedly. I also learned that Shorthand has a limit to the amount of sections that you can add to your webpage. Once I hit the limit I had to figure out how I was going to rearrange my text and charts to fit within that space.
